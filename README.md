# Belief embedding project 

This project contains the source codes and the dataset used to generate results of the study "Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making"  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237).


## Notes
fine-tuned language model is not included due to the size. 
One can obtain the same fine-tuned Sentence-BERT model using our dataset with the code src/Finetuning-SBERT_triplet_loss_revised-(roberta-base).py.
